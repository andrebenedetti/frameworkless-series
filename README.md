# Frameworkless

Amidst the rush of modern world and pressure to deliver things fast, we tend to use frameworks and libraries for all kinds of things.
"Don't reinvent the wheel", they say. 

And in many cases that's right, but sometimes we use a bazooka to kill a fly.

In this repo, though, we don't care about that. The whole purpose of this series of random implementations, from simple to hard things, from vanilla javascript tic tac toe games to reimplementing
things that standard library already provides us, **this repository is all about reinventing the wheel!**
