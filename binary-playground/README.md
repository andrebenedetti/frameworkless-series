# Binary Playground

This tiny project uses the (custom elements API)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements] to develop a simple page to build binary numbers.

The idea was to make a few more features demonstrating bitwise operation, but since the custom elements API isn't fully supported on Safari and I wanted to make this project publicly available on a website, I decided to do it on a separate project.
